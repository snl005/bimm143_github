## Background

As it is nearly Hallowneen and the halfway point in the quarter, let’s do a mini project to help us figure out the best candy!

Out come from the 538 website and is available as a CSV file.

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/candy-power-ranking/candy-data.csv", row.names = 1)
head(candy)
```

```{r}
library(flextable) 
flextable::flextable(head(candy,10))
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Almond Joy", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?

```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```

> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

## Quick overview of the dataset

```{r}
library("skimr")
skimr::skim(candy)
```

> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset? 

The winpercent is on a 0-100 scale but the remainings are on 0-1 scale.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column? 

A zero means it does not contain any chocolate and one means that there is chocolate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot (candy) +
aes(x=winpercent) +
geom_histogram(bins= 20)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

```{r}
ggplot (candy) +
aes(x=winpercent) +
geom_density()
```

The distribution is not symmetrical as it is slightly skewed to the right.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

```{r}
summary(candy$winpercent)
```

The center of the distribution is below 50%, it is observed to peak around 40% due to a median of 47.83%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

For chocolate:

```{r}
# 1. Find all chocolate candy in the dataset
choc.inds <- candy$chocolate == 1
# 2. Find their winpercent values
choc.win <- candy[choc.inds, ]$winpercent
# 3. Calculate the mean of these values
choc.mean <- mean(choc.win)
choc.mean
```

```{r}
# 4-6. Do the same for fruity candy
# 7. Compare mean winpercents of chocolate vs. fruity
# 8. Pick the highest as the winner
```

```{r}
mean(candy[candy$chocolate==1,]$winpercent)
```

For fruity:

```{r}
fruit.inds <- candy$fruity == 1
fruit.win <- candy[fruit.inds, ]$winpercent
fruit.mean <- mean(fruit.win)
fruit.mean
```

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc.win, fruit.win)
```

The difference is statisically significant due to a low p value of 2.817e-08.

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
candy %>% arrange(winpercent) %>%
head(5)
```

```{r}
candy$winpercent
```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?

```{r}
candy %>% arrange(desc(winpercent)) %>%
head(5)
```

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
ggplot (candy) +
  aes( winpercent, rownames(candy))+
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot (candy) +
  aes( x=winpercent, y=reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col()
```

Add some color based on the “type of candy”.

```{r}
my_cols <- rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "chocolate"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"
```

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
geom_col(fill=my_cols)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

The worst ranked chocolate candy is Sixlet.

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

The best ranked fruity candy is Starburst.

## Winpercent and Pricepercent

A plot with both variables/columns winpercent and pricepercent.

```{r}
library(ggrepel)
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] <-"red"
ggplot(candy) +
aes(x= winpercent, y= pricepercent, label = rownames(candy)) +
geom_point(col=my_cols)+
geom_text_repel(max.overlaps = 7)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?

Reese's Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

Nik L Lip, Ring pop, Nestles Smarties, Hershey’s Krackle, Hershey’s Milk Chocolate. The least popular is Nik L Lip.

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

## Exploring the correlation structures

Now that we’ve explored the dataset a little, we’ll see how the variables interact with each other... the corrplot package to plot a correlation matrix.

```{r}
library(corrplot)
```

```{r}
cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```

>Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?

Chocolate and Fruity.

> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?

Chocolate and Bar.

## Principal Component Analysis

The function to use is called prcomp() with an optional scale=T/F argument.

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale =TRUE)
summary (pca)
```

Our main PCA result figure:

```{r}
ggplot (pca$x) +
  aes(PC1,PC2, label = rownames(pca$x)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols)
```

We should also examine the variable “loadings” or contributions of the original variables to the new PCs.

```{r}
ggplot(pca$rotation) +
  aes(PC1, rownames(pca$rotation))+
  geom_col()
```

Interactive plots that can be zoomed on and “brushed” over can be made with the plotly package. Its output is interactive and will not render to PDF.
